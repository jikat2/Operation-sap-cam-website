    <p>Our Vision - Our vision at Project Green is to make a greener and more eco-friendly
      world through the use of technology. </p>

    <p>Project Green is a program that uses an API to get a satellite image from Sentinel Sat which is later analyzed to determine which parts of the land are adequate to plant in. The user has to input a latitude and longitude coordinate which would be the center of a square, and a size to find the appropriate satellite image. Then the image is received via an API from Sentinel Sat which is a platform that provides satellite images based off coordinates or address. Finally, the program runs two scans to keep the results fool proof. The first scan is to identify which soil is fertile and suitable for vegetation. The areas that do not have fertile soil are marked in black. Then, the areas that were considered as fertile soil go through a second scan this time looking for vegetation that may already be taking up space. If the soil is fertile, but there is already a lot of vegetation is the area, it is not feasible to plant trees in and would be marked black.</p>
